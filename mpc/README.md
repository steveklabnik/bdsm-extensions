# Extension README

This extension is a package extension that is used to install the
multiprecision (MPC) library

Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with arbitrarily high
precision and correct rounding of the result. It is built upon and follows the
same principles as Mpfr. The library is written by Andreas Enge,
Philippe Théveny, Paul Zimmermann and Mickaël Gastineau and is distributed under
the Gnu Lesser General Public License, either version 2.1 of the licence, or
(at your option) any later version. The Mpc library has been registered in
France by the Agence pour la Protection des Programmes on 2003-02-05 under the
number IDDN FR 001 060029 000 R P 2003 000 10000.
